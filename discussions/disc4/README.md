# Discussion 4: Data Types and Higher Order Functions
Due: 3 October 2020, 11:59pm EDT (No late submissions will be accepted)

Points: 100 public

## Introduction

This exercise consists of a few short functions to help you familiarize yourself with OCaml. You can review the content of the discussion in [notes.md](notes.md), which includes the topics and examples for the discussion.

### Testing & Submitting

You will submit this project to Gradescope.  You may only submit the **disc4.ml** file.  To test locally, run `dune runtest -f`.

## Part 1: Currying and Partial Applications

These function are best implemented using the concepts of currying and partial application. While you are not _required_ to implement them in this way, it is **_highly_** recommended.

#### `mul_n n lst`

- **Type**: `int -> int list -> int list`
- **Description**: Given an int list, multiply every element in the list by `n`
- **Examples**:
  ```ocaml
   mul_n 3 [1;2;3] = [3; 6; 9]
   mul_n 5 [1;2;3] = [5;10;15]
   mul_n 0 [1;2;3] = [0;0;0]
   mul_n 10 [] = []
   ```

#### `join strs sep`

- **Type**: `string list -> string -> string`
- **Description**: Given a list of strings and a separator, return a new string that is each string concatenated with the separator inbetween them.
- **Examples**:
  ```ocaml
  join ["a";"b";"c"] ", " = "a, b, c";
  join ["coffee"; "pizza"; "water"] " and " = "coffee and pizza and water"
  ```

## Part 2: Option Functions

#### `list_of_option o`

- **Type**: `'a option -> 'a list`
- **Description**: Take in an option and return `[]` of the option is `None` or `[a]` if the option is `Some a`.
- **Examples**:
  ```ocaml
  list_of_option None = []
  list_of_option (Some 1) = [1]
  list_of_option (Some (Some 3)) = [Some 3]
  ```

#### `match_key k p`

- **Type**: `'k -> 'k*'v -> 'v option`
- **Description**: If the pair `p`'s key matches `k` returns the value as an option. Otherwise return `None`
- **Examples**:
  ```ocaml
  match_key 1 (1, "str") = Some "str"
  match_key 2 (1, "str") = None
  match_key "key" ("key", "pizza") = Some "pizza"
  match_key "not key" ("key", "pizza") = None
  ```

## Part 3: LengthLists

For this part, you will be working with the `lengthlist` type. This type is meant to represent the idea of _run length encoding_ - essentially, compressing a list by grouping terms together if there are _multiple_ of the same term in a row. For example, the list `[1;1;1;1;2;2;2;3;3;4]` can be represented as, for example, using tuples of the form `(value, count)`, `[(1,4); (2, 3); (3, 2); (4, 1)]`.

The `'a lengthlist` type encodes this idea, while keeping the linkedlist structure of the default OCaml list. The type is defined as in below:

```ocaml
type 'a lengthlist =
    Cons of ('a * int * 'a lengthlist)
  | Empty
```

Now, we would represent the above list as `Cons(1, 4, Cons(2, 3, Cons(3, 2, Cons(4, 1, Empty))))`.  We ask you to implement the following functions for length lists.

#### `list_of_lengthlist llst`

- **Type**: `'a lengthlist -> 'a list`
- **Description**: Converts a lengthlist into its equivalent Ocaml list.
- **Examples**:
  ```ocaml
  list_of_lengthlist (Cons(1, 4, Cons(2, 3, Cons(3, 2, Cons(4, 1, Empty))))) = [1;1;1;1;2;2;2;3;3;4]
  list_of_lengthlist Empty = []
  list_of_lengthlist (Cons("hi", 2, Cons("hello", 3, Empty))) = ["hi"; "hi"; "hello"; "hello"; "hello"]
  ```

#### `map_lengthlist fn llst`

- **Type**: `('a->'b) -> 'a lengthlist -> 'b lengthlist`
- **Description**: Recreate the map function, but for lengthlists. Note that we only operate on the elements, and not the number of each element.
- **Examples**:
  ```ocaml
  map_lengthlist ((+) 3) (Cons(1, 4, Cons(2, 3, Cons(3, 2, Cons(4, 1, Empty))))) = Cons(4, 4, Cons(5, 3, Cons(6, 2, Cons(7, 1, Empty))))
  map_lengthlist string_of_int (Cons(1, 4, Cons(2, 3, Cons(3, 2, Cons(4, 1, Empty))))) = Cons("1:, 4, Cons("2", 3, Cons("3", 2, Cons("4", 1, Empty))))
  ```

#### `decrement_count llst`

- **Type**: `'a lengthlist -> 'a lengthlist`
- **Description**: Remove one of each element in the lengthlist. If the number of an element decreases to 0, remove it from the list entirely
- **Examples**:
  ```ocaml
  decrement_count (Cons(1, 4, Cons(2, 3, Cons(3, 2, Cons(4, 1, Empty))))) = Cons(1, 3, Cons(2, 2, Cons(3, 1, Empty)))
  decrement_count (Cons(1, 4, Cons(2, 3, Empty))) = Cons(1, 3, Cons(2, 2, Empty))
  decrement_count (Cons("str", 1, Empty)) = Empty
  decrement_count Empty = Empty
  ```
